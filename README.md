Picasa2Smugmug
==============

Synchronize a local Picasa managed picture repository into SmugMug

This program assumes a directory structure built of folders (just directories) and albums (directories with images). It will
scan the disk for all images, including metadata added in the Picasa.ini file and upload those into SmugMug with the 
appropriate hierarchy. 

It has the capability of synchronizing back from SmugMug into the same structure (restoring from backup).
